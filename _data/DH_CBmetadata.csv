London: Printed by Nicholas Okes for Richard Collins, 1633.",John Ford,application/pdf,"Ford, John",Tis Pitty Shee's a Whore. Acted by the Queenes Maiesties Servants at the Phoenix in Drury-Lane,Printed by Nicholas Okes for Richard Collins,1633,London,"$65,000.00",Liber Antiquus,Very good,First,English,"This is a very good first edition of John Ford’s arguably most important and canonical dramatic work. An incestuous riff on Romeo and Juliet, ‘Tis Pity is a revenge tragedy inhabiting a tricky moral territory as it tackles a taboo topic without shying away from violence and gore.  The play is set in Renaissance Parma and concerns the incestuous love between Annabella, whom the title refers to as “a whore”, and her brother Giovanni. It ends in an erotic sacrifice with Giovanni as both celebrant and executioner, making his final entry with Annabella's heart impaled on his own dagger. I have chosen this item as an example of a canonical text that threads consent through the political contract and the marriage contract, with the figure of the woman as wife and eternal subject. This well-preserved copy is testament to the status of the text in the canon."

It is “an attractive, fresh copy of a book usually found in poor condition.” The book contains 28 etched oval portraits of courtesans and procuresses, bearing their names and accompanied by quatrains in French, Dutch and German, describing the physical appearance of these women of pleasure and the clothes they wore. Below the portraits are details of their careers, with special attention to their first steps along the path to the profession and the locations where they plied their trade. This edition also includes a foreword in French, in which the honorable intention of the work was explained: that the author did not mean to encourage his readers to debauchery, but simply wanted to record the fashions of the age and educate his readers on how a “decent” girl could end up in “the trade”. This item would be an interesting accompaniment to Ford’s ‘Tis Pity to study the difference in representations of women as “whores”, a pejorative, in a work of fiction (allowing the author greater liberty in his fictionalized representation of women) and “courtesans”, an adulation, in a record of real women (necessitating a certain deference to the women described)."

Herringman, 1667.",Katherine Philips,application/pdf,"Philips, Katherine",Poems By the most deservedly Admired Mrs. Katherine Philips The Matchless Orinda,Printed by J. M. for H. Herringman,1667,London,"$13,500.00",,Fine,First,English,"This is a fine copy of the first sanctioned edition of poems by Katherine Phillips, asserted to be historically the “first” English female poet and deemed to be the first English woman to have her work published. This edition was preceded by a pirated and suppressed edition in 1664, which is referenced in the preface to this edition, in the form of a long letter by Phillips. This item is important because of its status as, supposedly, the “first” published work by an English woman, her fight to regain ownership and authority over its publication in light of it being spuriously published without her authorial consent. The exaltation of her genius as a “first” is represented in the well-preserved condition of this copy. However, for scholars who are interested in questions of female writerly and readerly communities, this book may be of special significance as it carries, what the bookseller describes as “an early signature of ‘Eliza Gray’ on [the] title, and a faded inscription “Dundas” on the front paste-down just below and in the same hand, ‘Given Eliza.’ This Eliza is possibly a relation of Agnes Gray (1622-1669), the wife of Sir John Dundas of Newliston. One possible candidate in Agnes’s extended family is Elizabeth Gray, daughter of John Gray, 9th Lord Gray of Crichie.” This item may be of interest to those researching early modern female literary collaborations and friendships, reader reception, and the intersections of gender and authorship, especially the topic of consent to be published."

This pronouncement appeared after years of public discontentment with the dysfunctional prison system and political corruption. This item is rare in North America and would increase the value of the collection. Moreover, it would offer scholars the opportunity to research the laws and policies governing disenfranchised individuals and communities in the early modern period, the political upheavals and legal changes brought about by public resentment, the early attempts at prison reform and social justice, and the role of people’s political consent in the machinations of legality, economy and labor.
